    <h1>The Walking Dead (TV series)</h1>
        <p>The Walking Dead is an American post-apocalyptic horror drama television series developed by Frank Darabont.
        It is based on the comic book series of the same name by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard.
        The series stars Andrew Lincoln as sheriff's deputy Rick Grimes,[3] who awakens from a coma to find a post-apocalyptic world
        dominated by flesh-eating zombies. He sets out to find his family and encounters many other survivors along the way.</p>
        <p>The Walking Dead premiered on October 31, 2010, on the cable television channel AMC in the United States.[4]
        It premiered internationally during the first week of November 2010 on Fox International Channels.[5] Based on its reception,
        AMC renewed the series for a second season of 13 episodes, which premiered on October 16, 2011.[6][7] Two episodes into the second season,
        AMC announced that the show would return for a third season of 16 episodes, which began airing on October 14, 2012.[8] On December 21, 2012,
        AMC renewed The Walking Dead for a fourth season of 16 episodes, which premiered on October 13, 2013.[9] On October 29, 2013,
        AMC renewed it for a fifth season,[10] scheduled to premiere on October 12, 2014.[11]</p>
    <h2>Season 1 (2010)</h2>
        <p>The series begins with sheriff's deputy[3] Rick Grimes being wounded in a shootout with armed criminals. He awakens weeks
            later from a coma in an abandoned and badly damaged hospital. Upon leaving, Rick discovers a post-apocalyptic world overrun
            with zombies (or "walkers", as they are often referred to in-show). Rick also discovers his wife and son are missing, and
            he encounters two survivors — Morgan Jones and his son Duane — who explain the situation to him. Acting on a rumor the Joneses
            had heard, Rick arms himself and begins a perilous journey to Atlanta, Georgia, where the CDC is said to have set up a quarantined
            safe zone in the city. Upon reaching Atlanta, he soon discovers the city has instead been overrun by walkers.</p>
        <p>A few miles outside the city, Rick's wife Lori and son Carl have been hiding from the walkers with Shane Walsh, Rick's partner
            and best friend, who has fallen in love with Lori. They have established a camp with a small group of fellow survivors. Several
            members of the group have gone to downtown Atlanta for supplies, and Glenn rescues Rick, who has been surrounded by walkers.
            Members of the group run into trouble with Daryl's brother, Merle, and Rick handcuffs him to a department store roof. Reunited
            at the camp with Lori and Carl, Rick assumes command with Shane. They soon go back to town in an attempt to rescue Merle and
            collect a cache of guns Rick left behind, but find only Merle's sawed-off hand. A band of walkers eventually attacks the
            camp and kills several people, including Amy. Most of the survivors flee to seek aid from the CDC, one family sets off on
            their own to find their relatives, and Jim — who sustained a walker's bite — is left on the road at his request.</p>
    <h2>Season 2 (2011-12</h2>
        <p>The second season begins with Rick and his group of survivors escaping the CDC. They decide Fort Benning will be their next
            destination. Along the way, they encounter a traffic jam of abandoned vehicles on Interstate 85. The group loots several vehicles,
            and the group assumes that all is well until a large herd of walkers approach and they are forced to disperse and hide under cars.
            A walker chases Carol's daughter, Sophia, out from her hiding spot and, with another walker, pursues her into the woods.
            Rick finds her but loses her again after drawing off the walkers. During the search for Sophia, a hunter named Otis accidentally
            shoots Carl. To get help for him, Otis leads Rick and Shane to a large, isolated farm owned by a veterinarian named Hershel Greene,
            then helps Shane look for medical supplies at the local high school. After getting them, Shane injures his leg and betrays Otis to
            the walkers so he can get away. The survivors then move to the farm while Carl recovers, trying to coexist with Hershel's family,
            but dangerous secrets and disagreements over leadership cause tensions to rise. Lori is revealed to be pregnant (she is not sure
            whether Rick or Shane is the father), and Glenn builds a romantic relationship with Maggie, Hershel's elder daughter.
            Glenn also discovers the barn is full of walkers, some whom are Hershel's family members and neighbors.
            After an angry Shane releases the walkers to be exterminated, Sophia emerges from the barn, as a walker, and
            Rick reluctantly shoots her.</p>
