===== Notes Week 2 ====
- Added some Modals for the images on the index page. They pop up a anime trailer for that image.

- Cleaned up the Search page and added some IMDB links.

- Cleaned up some code and moved some things around.

- I was testing out maybe adding a details page for each search result. I currently only have the one "Hunter x Hunter".

- I was looking over the Services section and researching ideas on how I should lay out that page. I may try to do a TV Guide style
  with the currently airing but that would be a huge table with lots of information. If I could fit all the services on one page that
  is the main goal. I need more research and brainstorming on how I can do it.

- I had family visiting me this week so I was not able to put as much work into this week as I did last week. I think that's why I spent so much
  time last week on the project just in case I could'nt get enough time this week to work on it.
